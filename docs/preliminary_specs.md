# Preliminary Hackthon Specifications

On June 14, 2025, Computational Science NL will host its first Hackathon in Utrecht. This event brings together researchers from various fields and sectors of computational science to collaborate on solving a challenge presented by Deltares, a research institute for applied research in the field of water and subsoil.

Participants will dive into the world of numerical methods for partial differential equations with an application related to Deltaresâ€™ core area of interest, and use their problem-solving skills and teamwork to develop innovative solutions to the challenge. The programming language will be Julia, but prior knowledge of Julia is not required.



Participants will have ~8 hours to collectively solve a challenge posed
by Deltares, focused on numerical modelling of partial differential
equations with an application relevant to Deltares' core research area
of interest. The programming language will be Julia, but no prior
experience with Julia is required. A team should consist of 2-5 people.
Basic knowledge in numerical modelling (finite differences, finite
elements, finite volumes) is beneficial, but you are not expected to
have any domain knowledge related to Deltares' research discipline.
