# Julia script to solve the 1D shallow water equations as a DAE problem
using NonlinearSolve, LinearAlgebra, Parameters, Plots, Sundials

# This code is a template for solving the 1D shallow water equations (SWE) as a DAE problem.
# The setup is as follows:
# 1. Define parameters for the simulation, including gravity, number of grid points,
#   spatial domain, and bottom topography.
# 2. Set up initial conditions for water height and momentum.
# 3. Define the DAE residual function that describes the SWE.
# 4. Implement a time loop to solve the DAE problem using Sundials' IDA solver.
# 5. Plot the results.
# 6. Function calls to start the simulation.


# --- 1. Parameter setup ---
function make_parameters()

    (; ...) #Add your parameters
end

# --- 2. Initial condition ---
function initial_conditions(params)
    # set up initial conditions here
    return h, q
end

# --- 3. DAE residual function ---
# Note: the "!" at the end of the function name indicates that the function modifies 
# its arguments (convention in Julia)
function swe_dae_residual!(residual, du, u, p, t)


    residual[...] = # set up residual here for all points or control volumes etc.
        return nothing
end

# --- 4. Time integration ---
function timeloop(params)
    # Unpack parameters 

    # set up initial conditions
    h0, q0 = initial_conditions(params)
    u0 = vcat(h0, q0)
    du0 = zeros(2N)  # Initial guess for du/dt

    tspan = (tstart, tstop) # defines the start and end times for the simulation

    # Specify differentiable variables as (true) -> all variables
    differential_vars = trues(2N)

    dae_prob = DAEProblem(
        swe_dae_residual!, du0, u0, tspan, params;
        differential_vars=differential_vars
    )
    sol = solve(dae_prob, IDA(), reltol=1e-8, abstol=1e-8) # solves the DAE problem using default settings

    # --- 5. a Live Plots ---

    return sol # return solution object
end

# --- 5. b Plotting results ---


# --- 6. Main script ---
# Set up parameters

# Call the time loop function
